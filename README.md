# Welcome!

Hi there, welcome to my `GitHub` website repository. The repository is a collection of blogs I have authored on Data Science and Machine Learning workflows. Feel free to use the codes and ideas but please acknowledge the effort. With years of experience in clinical trials data management and analysis, in most of the blogs, I show-case the most important skill of data pre-processing poplarly known as data management as a step to your analysis.

Enjoy the wonderfull posts!
