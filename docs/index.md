Hello, welcome to my GitHub page. My background is in Mathematics with an MSc. in Statistical Sciences.
I am excited about patient level data with over 6 years experience in health research data management and statistical analysis. I am a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast with a considerable amount of experience in various machine learning algorithms.

I love developing data products in RShiny and Rmarkdown (dashboards and dynamic reports). My major tool of trade is R but I also code in Python (not at the level I  do in R) and currently interested in learning SAS. I am currently working at Oxford University as an R Programmer and my focus is how to use my programming skills combined with statistical knowledge applied on real world datasets to improve health care.
